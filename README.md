This repository contains the source code for the Intelligent Cat Feeder System, an automated solution for feeding pets, particularly cats, in a controlled and monitored manner. The project aims to use modern technology to ensure pets are fed the correct amount of food at the right times, even in the absence of their owners.

### Project Description:

The Intelligent Cat Feeder System is designed to automate the pet feeding process using various sensors and motors controlled by a DFRduino Uno R3 microcontroller. It features a weight sensor for portion control, servo motors for managing the dispensing mechanism, and a stepper motor for precision control of the food dispensing process.

### Key Features:

Automated Food Dispensing: Precisely dispenses the correct amount of food based on programmed schedules or triggers.
Weight Monitoring: Uses a weight sensor to ensure accurate portion sizes and track food consumption.
Cat Recognition: (Optional feature) Integrates a camera and machine learning model for cat recognition, allowing for pet-specific feeding routines.

### Hardware Components:

1. DFRduino Uno R3
2. Weight Sensor Module (SEN0160)
3. Servo Motor (x2)
4. Stepper Motor
5. Software Requirements
